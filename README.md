# podman-arm64-x96
creating a podman machine for MacOS on M1/M2


Another in a short series of experiences with replacing Docker Desktop for MacOS.

This time around, it is based on [podman](https://podman.io) with the requirement to be able to create a single virtual machine ("engine") to run multi-arch, arm64, and x86_64/amd64 images.
